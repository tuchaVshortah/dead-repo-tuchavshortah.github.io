        <p class="para-font">The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with). Ritchie’s primary goals were to produce a minimalistic language that was easy to compile, allowed efficient access to memory, produced efficient code, and was self-contained (not reliant on other programs). For a high-level language, it was designed to give the programmer a lot of control, while still encouraging platform (hardware and operating system) independence (that is, the code didn’t have to be rewritten for each platform).</p>
        <p class="para-font"> C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken Thompson rewrote most of the Unix operating system using C. Many previous operating systems had been written in assembly. Unlike assembly, which produces programs that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled on many different types of computers and speeding its adoption. C and Unix had their fortunes tied together, and C’s popularity was in part tied to the success of Unix as an operating system.</p>
        <p class="para-font"> C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee (this means the ISO standards committee approved a document describing the C++ language, to help ensure all compilers adhere to the same set of standards). A minor update to the language was released in 2003 (called C++03). Four major updates to the C++ language (C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20) have been made since then, each adding additional functionality. C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities, and is widely considered to be the new baseline version of the language. Future upgrades to the language are expected every three or so years, with the feature set for C++23 already starting to be formulated.</p>
        <p class="para-font"> The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as “trust the programmer” -- which is both wonderful and dangerous. C++ is designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want. However, this also means the language often won’t stop you from doing things that don’t make sense, because it will assume you’re doing so for some reason it doesn’t understand. There are quite a few pitfalls that new programmers are likely to fall into if caught unaware. This is one of the primary reasons why knowing what you shouldn’t do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.</p>
