        <h1 class="highlight">What next?</h1>
        <p>By this point, you should have a solid understanding of the core C++ language. This sets you up well to continue your learning journey into other adjacent areas. So if there’s something you’re really interested in learning about, now’s a good time to see whether you have enough knowledge to jump into that.<br><br>
           However, for most users, I think there are a few natural next steps.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="section2" class="container-fluid text background rounded">
        <h1 class="highlight">Data structures and algorithms</h1>
        <p>If you haven’t already learned about these, this is my strongest recommendation.<br><br>

A data structure is a collection of data and a well defined set of methods to access or manipulate that data. The most common data structure used in programming is the array, which holds a number of elements of the same type in sequential memory. You can manipulate the data inside an array by using array indexing to directly access (or modify) the elements inside the array. In the lessons, we also covered the stack data structure, which provide push, pop, and top functions to access the data on the stack.<br><br>

An algorithm is a self-contained set of operations that typically manipulate or calculate outputs from the data in a data structure. For example, when you look through an array to find the median value, you’re executing an algorithm. Binary search is an algorithm to determine if a given value exists in a sorted array. Sorting routines (such as selection sort and bubble sort) are algorithms that sort data sets.<br><br>

Over the years, mathematicians and computer scientists have come up with a fairly standard set of reusable data structures and algorithms that are useful for constructing more complex programs. These all have various tradeoffs. For example, arrays are fast to access data and sort, but slow to add or remove elements. Linked lists, on the other hand, are slow to access data and sort, but very fast to add or remove elements (if you already know where those elements are).<br><br>

Why does it matter? Let’s use an analogy. If you were going to build a house, you could build all of your tools from scratch if you wanted. But it would take a long time, and you’d probably mess quite a few things up and have to start over (ever created a hammer? Me neither). Also, if you use the wrong tool for the job, your quality would suffer (try nailing in nails with a wrench).<br><br>

More likely, you’d go to the local hardware store and buy a few tools: a hammer, a level, a carpenter’s square, etc… and then read some internet tutorials on how to use them properly. These would vastly accelerate your house construction efforts.<br><br>

Data structures and algorithms serve the same purpose in programming: they are tools that, if you know how to use them, can vastly accelerate how quickly you can get things done at quality.<br><br>

The good news is that many of these data structures and algorithms have already been implemented in the standard library. You’ve already encountered some of these in the preceding tutorials: std::array, std::vector, std::stack, std::string, and std::sort, to name a few. Learning to use these effectively and appropriately is a great use of your time.<br><br>

If you’re short on time (or patience), learning how to use the most common data structures and algorithms is the minimum you should do. But if you have the inclination, try recreating those data structures yourself, from scratch. It’s really good practice on writing reusable code, and will help you down the road when something you need isn’t in the standard library. But then throw them out, and use the ones in the standard library. :)</p>

        <h1 class="highlight">The C++ standard library</h1>
        <p>The bulk of the C++ standard library is data structures and algorithms. However, the standard library contains other things too, and another next step could be to explore those. Among other things, there are numerics (math) libraries, input/output routines, functions to handle localization and regionalization, regular expressions, threading, and file access. Every new release of C++ (which has been happening about every 3 years now) adds a batch of new functionality into the standard library. It isn’t critical that you know how everything in there works, but it’s worth at least being aware of what exists, so that if you happen upon the need for it, you can go learn more as needed. https://cppreference.com/w/cpp is my go-to reference for discovering what exists.</p>

      <div id="section4" class="container-fluid text background rounded">
        <h1 class="highlight">Graphical applications</h1>
        <p>In our tutorial series, we developed console applications, because they’re easy, cross-platform, and don’t require installing additional software. Unlike many modern programming languages, C++ does not come with functionality to create application windows, or to populate those windows with graphical elements or graphical user interface widgets (checkboxes, sliders, etc…). To do those things in C++, you’ll need to enlist the help of a 3rd party library.<br><br>

Getting a graphical application up and running requires a few additional steps. First, you’ll need to actually install the 3rd party library and connect it to your IDE, so you can compile it into your program. Most graphical libraries should come with instructions on how to do this for the most popular IDEs. Next, you need to instantiate an OS window, which requires calling certain function from the toolkit. Most, if not all, of the libraries should have sample programs that you can compile and dissect if you’re not sure how to do something basic.<br><br>

There are a lot of libraries out there, and which one you should use depends on your requirements (you’ll have to do your own research to determine which one is right for you). Popular choices include Qt, WxWidgets, SDL, and SFML. If you want to do 3d graphics, all of these frameworks support OpenGL, and there are great OpenGL tutorials on the internet.<br><br>

Graphical applications typically run differently than console applications. With a console application, the program starts executing at the top of main() and then runs sequentially, usually stopping only for user input. Graphical applications also start executing at the top of main(), typically spawn a window, populate it with graphics or widgets, and then go into an infinite loop waiting for the user to interact with the window (via mouse click or keyboard). This infinite loop is called an event loop, and when a click or keypress happens, that event is routed to the function(s) that handle that type of event. This is called event handling. Once the event is handled, the event loop continues to run, waiting for the next bit of user input.</p>
