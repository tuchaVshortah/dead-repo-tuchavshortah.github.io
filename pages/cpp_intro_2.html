        <p class="para-font">A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action. Statements are by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program. This is because they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language. When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in sentences (not in random words or syllables). In C++, when we want to have our program do something, we typically write statements. Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, it’s probably a statement. In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language instructions.</p>
        <p class="para-font">Programs typically terminate (finish running) when the last statement inside function main has executed (though programs may abort early in some circumstances, or do some cleanup afterwards). Functions are typically written to do a specific job. For example, a function named “max” might contain statements that figures out which of two numbers is larger. A function named “calculateGrade” might calculate a student’s grade from a set of test scores. We will talk a lot more about functions soon, as they are the most commonly used organizing tool in a program.</p>
        <p class="para-font">In English, sentences are constructed according to specific grammatical rules that you probably learned in English class in school. For example, normal sentences end in a period. The rules that govern how sentences are constructed in a language is called syntax. If you forget the period and run two sentences together, this is a violation of the English language syntax. C++ has a syntax too: rules about how your programs must be constructed in order to be considered valid. When you compile your program, the compiler is responsible for making sure your program follows the basic syntax of the C++ language. If you violate a rule, the compiler will complain when you try to compile your program, and issue you a syntax error.</p>
        <p class="para-font"> Syntax errors are common when writing a program. Fortunately, they’re typically straightforward to find and fix, as the compiler will generally point you right at them. Compilation of a program will only complete once all syntax errors are resolved.</p>
