        <p class="para-font">You already know that every executable program must have a function named main (which is where the program starts execution when it is run). However, as programs start to get longer and longer, putting all the code inside the main function becomes increasingly hard to manage. Functions provide a way for us to split our programs into small, modular chunks that are easier to organize, test, and use. Most programs use many functions. The C++ standard library comes with plenty of already-written functions for you to use -- however, it’s just as common to write your own. Functions that you write yourself are called user-defined functions.

Consider a case that might occur in real life: you’re reading a book, when you remember you need to make a phone call. You put a bookmark in your book, make the phone call, and when you are done with the phone call, you return to the place you bookmarked and continue your book precisely where you left off.

C++ programs can work the same way. A program will be executing statements sequentially inside one function when it encounters a function call. A function call is an expression that tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. The CPU “puts a bookmark” at the current point of execution, and then calls (executes) the function named in the function call. When the called function ends, the CPU returns back to the point it bookmarked, and resumes execution.</p>
        <p class="para-font">When you write a user-defined function, you get to determine whether your function will return a value back to the caller or not. To return a value back to the caller, two things are needed. First, your function has to indicate what type of value will be returned. This is done by setting the function’s return type, which is the type that is defined before the function’s name. In the example above, function getValueFromUser has a return type of void, and function main has a return type of int. Note that this doesn’t determine what specific value is returned -- only the type of the value. Second, inside the function that will return a value, we use a return statement to indicate the specific value being returned to the caller. The specific value returned from a function is called the return value. When the return statement is executed, the return value is copied from the function back to the caller. This process is called return by value.</p>
        <p class="para-font">You now have the conceptual tools to understand how the main function actually works. When the program is executed, the operating system makes a function call to main. Execution then jumps to the top of main. The statements in main are executed sequentially. Finally, main returns an integer value (usually 0), and your program terminates. The return value from main is sometimes called a status code (also sometimes called an exit code, or rarely a return code), as it is used to indicate whether the program ran successfully or not. By definition, a status code of 0 means the program executed successfully.</p>
        <p class="para-font">While this program works, it’s a little redundant. In fact, this program violates one of the central tenets of good programming: “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (often abbreviated “DRY”). Why is repeated code bad? If we wanted to change the text “Enter an integer:” to something else, we’d have to update it in two locations. And what if we wanted to initialize 10 variables instead of 2? That would be a lot of redundant code (making our programs longer and harder to understand), and a lot of room for typos to creep in.</p>
